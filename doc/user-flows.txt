Workflows:

User signs in, if they don't have any environments or machines reporting in, we give a great "to get started, add this script to cron."

See currently running processes on a machine, then click on it and get its data.

Would like to search for processes that have run on the machine by name, then click on it and get all of its historical data.
  Historical data:
    Port availability (changes?)
    Graphed time-series
    Time started
    Time ended(?)
    Args

Any given time: list of current processes (upids?)
  hgetall each upid...

List of all processes that have been seen on a machine by args/ucomm (search box to find a process that may not be running any more.)
